    <p><h3>Pancakes</h3></p>
    <p>French toast's cousin, pancakes</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter, plus more (unmelted) butter for cooking</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large skillet, preferably non-stick, over medium-low heat while you make the batter.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl and stir to mix well. In a smaller bowl, beat the eggs with
                1 1/2 cups of the milk, then stir in the 2 tablespoons cooled melted butter.</li>
            <li>Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring only enough to moisten the flour and distribute the liquid evenly;
                don't worry about a few lumps. If the batter seems thick, add a little more milk-the thinner the batter, the thinner the pancakes
                and the more they'll spread out in the pan.</li>
             <li>Sprinkle a couple drops of water into the pan; if the drops skid across the surface before evaporating, it's hot enough.
                If not, turn up the heat a bit. Put a pat of butter in the skillet. When it stops foaming, ladle small amounts of batter
                onto the skillet, making any size pancakes you like. Cook, undisturbed, until the edges are set and bubbles appear in the
                center of the pancakes, 2 to 4 minutes. If the pancakes are cooking too fast or too slowly, adjust the heat a little bit at a time.</li>
             <li>Carefully slip a spatula under a pancake to peek and see if it's brown on the bottom. If so, lift it from the pan and
                turn it over. Cook the second side until it's lightly browned, another 2 or 3 minutes, and serve right away.
             </li>
        </ol>
